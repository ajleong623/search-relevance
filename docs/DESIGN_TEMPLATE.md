# Technical Design Template

> **Note**: This template provides a structure for technical design documents in the OpenSearch search-relevance project. Remove sections that don't apply to your use case.

> **Target Audience**: Development teams building features and enhancements for the search-relevance plugin.

## Introduction

**TODO**: Briefly introduce your design document and outline what it covers.

## Problem Statement

**TODO**: Clearly describe the problem:

- What is the problem and why does it need to be solved?
- What is the impact of not implementing this?
- Who are the primary users/stakeholders?
- How does this align with OpenSearch project goals?

## Use Cases

**TODO**: List user stories driving your design:
- Mark required vs. nice-to-have use cases
- Link relevant GitHub issues
- Include search relevance specific scenarios (experiments, metrics, judgments)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**TODO**: List essential requirements for your design.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**TODO**: List performance, scalability, and maintainability requirements.

## Out of Scope

**TODO**: Clearly define what will NOT be covered in this design.

## Current State

**TODO**: Describe the current system state and components that will be impacted.

## Solution Overview

**TODO**: Summarize your proposed solution:
- Key technologies and dependencies
- Integration with OpenSearch core
- Interaction with existing search-relevance features

## Solution Design

### Proposed Solution

**TODO**: Describe your solution with:
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications (if applicable)
- Plugin-specific components (indices, processors, executors)
- How it addresses each use case

### Alternative Solutions Considered

**TODO**: Document alternatives with pros/cons for each.

### Key Design Decisions

**TODO**: Summarize critical decisions:
- Technology choices and rationale
- Trade-offs made
- Impact on existing functionality

## Metrics and Observability

**TODO**: Define monitoring strategy:
- New metrics to be introduced
- Search relevance specific metrics (evaluation results, experiment metrics)
- Health and performance monitoring

## Technical Specifications

**TODO**: Provide detailed specifications:
- Data schemas and index mappings
- API specifications with examples (if applicable)
- Integration with search-relevance data models
- Class/sequence diagrams for complex flows

## Backward Compatibility

**TODO**: Address compatibility:
- Breaking changes and migration strategy
- Index mapping changes
- Plugin upgrade considerations

## Security Considerations

**TODO**: Provide comprehensive security analysis for threat modeling:

### Security Overview
- Describe the security context of your feature
- Identify sensitive data handled by the feature
- Define trust boundaries and data flow

### Assets and Resources
- List all assets that need protection (data, APIs, configurations)
- Identify system indices and their access patterns
- Document any cached or stored sensitive information

### API Security (if applicable)
- For each API endpoint, specify:
  - HTTP method and endpoint path
  - Whether it's mutating or non-mutating
  - Authorization requirements
  - Input validation requirements
  - Rate limiting considerations

### Threat Analysis
Using STRIDE methodology, identify potential threats:
- **Spoofing**: Can an attacker impersonate a user or component?
- **Tampering**: Can data be maliciously modified?
- **Repudiation**: Are actions properly logged and auditable?
- **Information Disclosure**: Could sensitive data be exposed?
- **Denial of Service**: Can the system be overwhelmed?
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Can attackers gain unauthorized access?

### Attack Vectors
Consider these potential attackers:
- Unauthorized users without cluster access
- Authorized users with limited permissions
- Users with read-only access attempting modifications
- Malicious inputs through APIs or data ingestion

### Security Mitigations
For each identified threat, provide:
- Specific mitigation strategies
- Input validation and sanitization approaches
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Encryption requirements (data at rest/in transit)
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Integration with OpenSearch security plugin

### Security Testing Requirements
- Security-specific test cases
- Input validation testing
- Authorization boundary testing
- Performance testing for DoS prevention

## Testing Strategy

**TODO**: Define testing approach:
- Unit and integration testing
- Performance testing
- Compatibility testing across OpenSearch versions

## Performance and Benchmarking

**TODO**: Define performance criteria:
- Key performance indicators
- Resource utilization targets
- Benchmark methodology and results
